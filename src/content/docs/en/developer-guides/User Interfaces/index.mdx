YAMP offers multiple solutions for building user interfaces, catering to different needs regarding performance and features.

*   **Ultralight:** Targeted as the primary high-performance option, suitable for demanding UI elements where efficiency is critical. (See [Ultralight Guide](./ultralight-guide.md))
*   **CEF (Chromium Embedded Framework):** A more feature-rich, stable alternative based on Chromium, suitable for complex UIs that might resemble web pages. It generally has a higher performance overhead than Ultralight. (See [CEF Guide](./cef-guide.md))

The goal is to provide developers with UI toolkits focused on performance and ease of development that integrate seamlessly with the available runtimes. Key considerations when choosing include performance impact, ease of development, feature set (HTML/CSS/JS support), and cross-platform compatibility.

See the specific guides for details on each solution's API and usage. ([UI Best Practices](./ui-best-practices.md))
