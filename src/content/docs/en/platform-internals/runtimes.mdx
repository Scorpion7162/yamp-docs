title: Runtimes
---

YAMP supports multiple scripting runtimes, allowing developers to choose the language that best suits their preferences and project needs.

## Officially Supported Runtimes
*   **Lua:** A lightweight, embeddable scripting language known for its simplicity and speed. Often favored for rapid development and common game logic.
*   **JavaScript (JS):** A widely-used, versatile language with a vast ecosystem. Suitable for various tasks, including UI development when paired with compatible frameworks.

These runtimes provide APIs to interact with the YAMP platform's features (entities, events, natives, etc.).

## Extensibility via C SDK
Beyond the official runtimes, YAMP provides a core **C SDK**. This SDK exposes the underlying platform APIs, enabling the community to:
*   Develop and integrate support for additional languages (e.g., Python, Rust, Go).
*   Build custom runtimes with unique features or integrations.

This fosters an extensible ecosystem where the community can contribute significantly to the platform's capabilities. (See [SDK Development](../sdk-development/introduction.md))
