title: Networking Architecture
---

YAMP employs a modern client-server networking architecture, departing significantly from the peer-to-peer model used by GTA Online and FiveM. All game state and logic are managed authoritatively by the server.

Synchronization is handled through efficient state replication, ensuring that clients receive timely updates about relevant entities and events. We prioritize low-latency updates for critical actions while optimizing bandwidth for less crucial state changes.

Developers interact with the networking layer through a clear API, simplifying the process of creating networked gameplay features without needing deep knowledge of the underlying protocols.
