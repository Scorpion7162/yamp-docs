title: Event System
---

YAMP utilizes an event system for communication and reacting to occurrences within the game. This system facilitates communication:
*   Between different resources on the server.
*   Between the server and clients.
*   Between different resources on the client.

## Purpose
Events help decouple game logic and create reactive systems. Instead of one script directly calling functions in another, it can trigger an event, and any interested scripts can subscribe (listen) to that event and react accordingly.

## Types of Events
*   **Built-in Events:** The platform emits events for common occurrences like player connections/disconnections, entity creation/destruction, damage events, entity enter/leave stream range, etc.
*   **Custom Events:** Developers can define and trigger their own custom events to signal specific game logic milestones or communicate between their resources.
*   **Client \<-> Server Events:** Events can be triggered on the server to be received by specific clients (or all clients), and clients can trigger events intended for the server (which should always be validated server-side for security).

## Usage
Developers use API functions to:
*   **Subscribe (On):** Register a handler function to be called when a specific event occurs.
*   **Trigger (Emit):** Fire an event, optionally passing data along with it.
*   **Unsubscribe (Off):** Remove a previously registered handler.

Refer to the [Event Handling Guide](../../developer-guides/event-handling.md) and the API Reference for specific event names and usage details.
