title: Introduction to the C SDK
---

YAMP provides a core C Software Development Kit (SDK) for advanced users and platform contributors.

## Purpose
The C SDK exposes the fundamental, low-level APIs of the YAMP platform. Its primary purposes are:
1.  **Creating Custom Runtimes:** Enabling developers to build support for scripting languages beyond the officially supported Lua and TypeScript (e.g., Python, Rust, Go, etc.).
2.  **Developing Platform Extensions:** Building native modules or plugins that integrate deeply with the YAMP core, potentially offering new features or performance optimizations not achievable through scripting alone.

## Audience
This section is intended for developers comfortable with C/C++ development and low-level systems programming. It is **not** required for typical server development using the standard Lua or TypeScript runtimes.

## Capabilities
Using the C SDK, you can interact directly with:
*   Core event loops
*   Entity management functions
*   Native function invocation
*   Networking internals (to a degree)
*   Resource management hooks

Refer to the subsequent guides for details on building runtimes and extensions. ([Building Custom Runtimes](./building-custom-runtimes.md), [Platform Extension Guides](./platform-extension-guides.md))
